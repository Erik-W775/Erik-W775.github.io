### ***Artifact 1 Enhancement*** 

The artifact that I selected for this enhancement was my final project for CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization in early 2021. The set up for the project was to select several objects with at least 1 that was comprised of multiple objects and render them using C++ and OpenGL.

***Enhancement Outcome***

Enhancements: Software and IDE update, Image creation and modifications, template creation, “World” view keyboard navigation, and added code.

Outcomes: Better image creation, updates to colors, textures, showing lighting reflection, modularity using templates and block coding, added readability using commenting and removing unused code and variables, increased code security using testing throughout code, updating software, and removing unused code and comments.

Course Outcomes found in Enhancement 1: In this artifact enhancement, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments for a diverse audience by adding inline comments as well as header information. I created a video that showed the existing code and how I intended to enhance it. I designed, developed, and delivered a project that was accompanied by professional quality assessment and video code review that clearly stated my goals and intentions and outcomes. I used software design and engineering mindset to solve the problem of code not compiling initially and to add additional navigation for the world view. I demonstrated that I can and have used well founded and innovative skills by creating a template and ensuring that the code is modular and usable by many different audiences. I demonstrated that I have a security mindset by performing an initial code review, removing unused variables and calculations and applied inline commenting and notes for reference. I was able to add to the codes usage by creating a template file that will help start projects in the future and that includes many shape and shader files as well as proper pathing for libraries. This will speed up initial project startup and aid in creation of other library files as needed. The code is more secure because I updated my development and operating system software prior to starting the new project and now it is operating in the most up to date versions. I created secure code that can be communicated and resourced by ensuring that it was clearly commented, free of unused calculations and variables, and I tested the code incrementally as I developed it.
