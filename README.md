### ***Artifact 1 Enhancement*** 

The artifact that I selected for this enhancement was my final project for CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization in early 2021. The set up for the project was to select several objects with at least 1 that was comprised of multiple objects and render them using C++ and OpenGL.

---
***Enhancement Outcome***

Enhancements: Software and IDE update, Image creation and modifications, template creation, “World” view keyboard navigation, and added code.

Outcomes: Better image creation, updates to colors, textures, showing lighting reflection, modularity using templates and block coding, added readability using commenting and removing unused code and variables, increased code security using testing throughout code, updating software, and removing unused code and comments.

Course Outcomes found in Enhancement 1: In this artifact enhancement, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments for a diverse audience by adding inline comments as well as header information. I created a video that showed the existing code and how I intended to enhance it. I designed, developed, and delivered a project that was accompanied by professional quality assessment and video code review that clearly stated my goals and intentions and outcomes. I used software design and engineering mindset to solve the problem of code not compiling initially and to add additional navigation for the world view. I demonstrated that I can and have used well founded and innovative skills by creating a template and ensuring that the code is modular and usable by many different audiences. I demonstrated that I have a security mindset by performing an initial code review, removing unused variables and calculations and applied inline commenting and notes for reference. I was able to add to the codes usage by creating a template file that will help start projects in the future and that includes many shape and shader files as well as proper pathing for libraries. This will speed up initial project startup and aid in creation of other library files as needed. The code is more secure because I updated my development and operating system software prior to starting the new project and now it is operating in the most up to date versions. I created secure code that can be communicated and resourced by ensuring that it was clearly commented, free of unused calculations and variables, and I tested the code incrementally as I developed it.

### ***Artifact 2 Enhancement*** 

The artifact that I selected for this enhancement is from CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle that I took in April of 2020. The program was intended to scroll through multiple slides providing images of “wellness” vacation destinations as a first stage to building a website (website was not in the scope but described in the course prompt).

***Enhancement Outcome***

Enhancements: Updated Ide and integrated code, debugged slideshow functionality, added button with functionality to link to websites or external links

Course Outcomes found in Enhancement 2: This artifact through enhancement and assessment shows that I have employed strategies for building a collaborative environment by incorporating in-line comments with sufficient insight into the intention of code. I have shown that I can discuss my decisions in code development using documentation and support materials such as flow charts and code review videos.  I have designed, developed, and delivered professional documentation and coherent well commented Java program code that executes as intended and is developed in line with my enhancement plan and flow chart. I have included assessment documentation that demonstrates that I can communicate my intentions and outcomes with a varied audience and have conveyed my ideas clearly through written report (assessment), within code using header and inline comments, and visual and oral media using my recorded code review. I have evaluated computing solutions using code that was not compiling and working algorithmically, starting with a plan, creating a workflow diagram, and working through the code incrementally and testing as I developed moving to the next step only when the code was complete and operating as intended. I have demonstrated that I have the ability to us well-founded and innovative techniques by starting at the beginning and performing iterative testing while correcting existing issues and performing my enhancements. The code was developed using a development lifecycle by starting with investigating the problem (choosing and artifact), I created a well-documented plan of enhancement, then I performed a video code review, and developed the code iteratively while testing, and finally I commented the code and documented the outcomes in this assessment. I have shown that I can employ and develop a security mindset by including comments in my code, performing a code review, and removed unnecessary test cases, I have ensured that there are no unused variables or calculations, and I have ensured that all software and development environments have been updated and running current releases.
