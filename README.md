### ***Artifact 1 Enhancement*** 

The artifact that I selected for this enhancement was my final project for CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization in early 2021. The set up for the project was to select several objects with at least 1 that was comprised of multiple objects and render them using C++ and OpenGL.

***Enhancement Outcome***

Enhancements: Software and IDE update, Image creation and modifications, template creation, “World” view keyboard navigation, and added code.

Outcomes: Better image creation, updates to colors, textures, showing lighting reflection, modularity using templates and block coding, added readability using commenting and removing unused code and variables, increased code security using testing throughout code, updating software, and removing unused code and comments.
